# `@henryqw/pi-codegraph`

Get a separate [CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) index when you start Pi in a new Git worktree, and let agents explore the indexed code with the `codegraph_explore` tool.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @colbymchenry/codegraph
pi install npm:@henryqw/pi-codegraph
```

Requires only the `codegraph` executable on Pi's `PATH`. No MCP server or MCP configuration is needed.

## Works with

| Package | Relationship | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@colbymchenry/codegraph`](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) | Required | Builds the indexes and answers `codegraph explore` queries. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-footer`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-footer) | Improves | Shows CodeGraph index status, quiet setup progress, and direct tool activity when loaded. |

## Use

From the primary checkout, initialize CodeGraph once:

```bash
codegraph init --yes
```

Then launch `pi` in a linked worktree. When the primary checkout has an index, pi-codegraph initializes a separate worktree index.

| Surface | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codegraph_explore` | tool | Lets agents explore the indexed code. It returns the source of the relevant symbols grouped by file, plus the call path between them. |
| CodeGraph setup status | ui | Shows an icon and `CG`: `✓ CG` when indexed, `○ CG` when missing, or a dim spinner and elapsed time during setup. Setup errors remain visible with recovery instructions. |

`codegraph_explore` takes a `query`, an optional `maxFiles` (default 12), and an optional `projectPath` (defaults to Pi's working directory). It runs `codegraph explore --path <projectPath> --max-files <maxFiles> <query>` and returns the output as-is. If the command exits with an error or runs longer than 120 seconds, the tool call fails and shows the end of CodeGraph's error output.

The tool works the same with Pi's `codemode`, including `codemode.mode` set to `only`. Scripts call `tools.codegraph_explore({ query })` and receive CodeGraph's text output as a string, because the tool declares no `outputSchema`. Scripts can split, search, or slice that text before printing a summary. Only what the script prints reaches the model, so print the whole string when the complete source is needed.

## Flow

- A missing worktree index is built only when the primary checkout already has `.codegraph/codegraph.db`.
- Initialization happens when Pi launches, not when Git creates the worktree. In TUI mode it runs in the background so the footer and later startup handlers can load.
- Each linked worktree keeps its own `.codegraph`; databases are never copied or shared between branches.
- Non-Git directories and repositories without a primary index are not initialized.
- Setup shows a dim footer status such as `⠋ CG · indexing 8s`, or `waiting for index` when another session holds the initialization lock. Only TUI mode animates the spinner. When setup finishes, the spinner becomes `✓ CG` for an existing or newly created index, or `○ CG` for a Git repository without an index. Non-Git directories show no index badge. There is no success notification.
- Missing prerequisites and setup failures remain visible as `! CG: prerequisites missing` or `! CG: setup failed`, with a theme-colored `!` icon and an actionable notification.
- Creating, resuming, or forking a session waits for in-flight worktree initialization instead of interrupting it. Repeated startup events reuse that initialization. Quitting or reloading Pi cancels the initializer and every Git probe; interrupted initialization keeps the lock for explicit recovery.
- If `pi-footer` is also loaded, it preserves the setup status on its third line and temporarily shows `● CG` during direct `codegraph_explore` calls.

## State and storage

The extension relies on CodeGraph's own state — each worktree maintains its own `.codegraph/codegraph.db`. The extension never copies or shares the database and does not write it directly: it delegates creation to `codegraph init --yes <worktree-root>`. Existing indexes are left alone.

## Limits and recovery

At startup, the extension runs `codegraph --version`. If that fails, Pi warns, reports `prerequisites missing`, and skips setup. Restart Pi or run `/reload` after fixing prerequisites.

Initialization uses an exclusive `pi-codegraph-init.lock` in the worktree's Git metadata. Failed or interrupted initialization keeps the lock so a partial database is not accepted. To recover, first confirm no initializer is running, then run `codegraph index` **from the affected worktree root** (not the primary checkout or a nested directory). Only after it succeeds, remove the lock directory with `rmdir` using the path in the error message, then run `/reload`:

```bash
cd /path/to/affected-worktree-root && codegraph index && rmdir /path/to/pi-codegraph-init.lock
```

The package never installs prerequisites automatically. Only Git worktree-root indexes using the default `.codegraph` directory are supported; nested monorepo indexes are not initialized automatically. The primary checkout must remain indexed for automatic opt-in detection.

Do not remove an active lock. Existing indexes without an extension-owned lock are not health-checked. The lock coordinates this extension's sessions, not manual `codegraph init` commands; avoid running those during initialization.

The extension does not add ignore rules, delete indexes, or prune worktrees — add `.codegraph/` to your own ignore rules if needed. Pi Subagent conservatively treats ignored files as retained work: an indexed worker worktree may require manual cleanup.
