# Pi Subagent maintenance rules

Follow [ADR 016](../../docs/adr/016-pi-subagent-architecture.md) and the [orchestration/API contract](docs/orchestration.md). These implementation boundaries supplement the repository rules.

## Sources and boundaries

- Define related names, limits, and statuses once as typed readonly values; derive schemas and display forms rather than duplicating literals. Use Pi's effective registries for Skills, models, and tools, not package catalogs.
- `createRoleLaunch` owns launch policy: Role resources, route, trust, environment, and Pi arguments. The Ephemeral Executor receives a prepared launch and owns only execution mechanics.
- `delegate_task` owns flat single, parallel, and chain delegation. Library callers own durable state, checks, review, integration, retry, and cleanup policy.

## Launches

- Put stable child identity and Role instructions before per-run task, paths, and recovery guidance in prompts.
- Route precedence is call `modelClass` > Role `modelClass` > configured Model Task assignment/default. Main uses `extensions/model-class-policy.ts` for explicit classes; direct `model` replaces only the route model, not its thinking level. Apply the same policy in every delegation tool.
- Fail before launch on malformed config or unavailable explicitly requested resources, naming the missing value and provider. Launch only through active Pi; no standalone discovery or fallback runtime.
- Disable ambient child extensions and Skills. An explicitly selected Role or caller extension activates all its registered tools and Pi-discovered Skills, alongside named Role Skills. Exclude Main-only delegation/orchestration tools, and verify explicit tool names against the final registry.
- Keep `delegate_task` mode explicit. Direct mode runs explicitly authorized bounded single, parallel, and chain tasks with the Role's declared resources in the shared checkout, including writes and commits without rollback or checked integration. Potential-writer completion requires an explicit succeeded outcome; failure, blocked work, or malformed completion retains admission. Checked changesets require isolated task graphs; neither mode may silently fall back to the other.
- Keep Roles capability-focused; requests own isolation. pi-subagent owns checked validation, judgment, integration, recovery, and cleanup while library exports remain reusable mechanisms.

## Executor and evidence

- Acquire a FIFO permit before preparing launch state. Queue time must not create worktrees, resolve queued resources, start timeouts, or occupy an active slot.
- Start idle and maximum deadlines when the child starts; only recognized Pi JSON events renew idle. Maximum runtime wins. Bound output and JSON events, preserving valid UTF-8 and aggregate Usage on every terminal outcome without double counting.
- Observer callback failure is a typed executor failure: terminate the child and release the permit. Give each process, stream, timer, listener, worktree, and UI resource one owner and one idempotent cleanup path.
- Worktree helpers are policy-neutral; cleanup is non-forced and reports retained or uncertain work. `prepareExactReviewEvidence` derives Git identity and a private exact base-to-tip patch; callers own review decisions. Never weaken OID, patch bounds, private-file, or clean-state checks.

## Results and validation

- Keep discriminated outcome/status unions exhaustive. Tie asynchronous follow-up delivery to the launching session generation: suppress stale results after replacement or shutdown, retaining exact direct tab identities and isolated work for recovery.
- Do not introduce a whole-request productive deadline; child, I/O, status, termination, and cleanup safety bounds remain local.
- Update compact UI state on events; rendering reads memory only. Bound visible text while preserving structured identity, status, usage, and recovery details.
- Test policy at its owning layer: parsing/planning directly, executor protocol in `ephemeral.test.ts`, direct delegation in `subagent.test.ts`, checked orchestration in isolated runner/runtime suites, and worktree/evidence mechanics in their focused suites. Prove performance invariants with operation counts or forbidden-operation assertions, not timing thresholds.
