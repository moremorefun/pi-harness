# `@henryqw/pi-deps`

Start locked Node and uv dependency installs whenever Git creates a worktree for an opted-in repository. Developers using several worktree tools get one shared hook without adding work to every Pi startup.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@henryqw/pi-deps
```

## Use

Run `/deps` in a trusted repository to enable preparation. Create a worktree through Git so its `post-checkout` hook runs, then open Pi in TUI mode there to see install progress and the result. Run `/deps` again to disable future preparation.

| Surface | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/deps` | command | For humans: enable or disable preparation for future Git worktrees in this repository. |
| Pi worktree status widget | ui | For humans in TUI mode: show background install progress and its result in a prepared worktree. |

- The shared `post-checkout` hook applies to every worktree in the repository; run `/deps` from any worktree to toggle it.
- Hooks without this package's marker are never overwritten or removed.
- After updating the package, run `/deps` twice in each opted-in repository. This replaces the copied hook with the current version.

## Flow

![Dependency preparation with synchronous validation and detached installs](./docs/dependency-preparation-flow.svg)

- Worktree creation returns without waiting for dependency installation when the hook runs.
- The hook validates lockfiles synchronously. Conflicting Node lockfiles, `packageManager` mismatches, and unsupported declarations still fail the worktree command fast.
- A detached installer runs frozen installs in the background.
- A Pi TUI session in the worktree watches for install progress without waiting for completion at startup. It auto-dismisses success after five seconds and reports failures, including missing executables, that it observes during its ten-minute wait. RPC, JSON, and print sessions do not show or consume this status.

Node and uv both run when both lockfile types exist.

## State and storage

The installer stores its result in `<worktree gitdir>/pi-deps/status.json`. Command output is in the adjacent `install.log`.

The status file is removed once a Pi TUI session reports it. Other tools that create worktrees get the same background install only when they invoke Git's `post-checkout` hook; tools that do not run the hook, including those that create detached worktrees without a checkout, do not prepare dependencies. Non-Pi consumers must read the status file themselves.

## Limits and recovery

Dependency installation may execute repository-controlled build and install scripts. Enable only repositories you trust.

- A configured `core.hooksPath` replaces the shared hooks directory. `/deps` refuses instead of installing where Git would ignore or share the hook.
- Only Git-root lockfiles are inspected.
- Root npm and uv workspaces remain package-manager concerns. Nested independent projects are not scanned.
- Already-present `node_modules` skips Node installs; `.pnp.cjs` skips Yarn installs only; `.venv` skips uv installs.
- Worktrees created with `git worktree add --no-checkout` never run `post-checkout`, so they are not prepared. `git worktree add --detach` with a checkout does run the hook.
- Installs finish after creation returns. A consumer may use a worktree before dependencies are ready.
- If status is still `running` after ten minutes, the TUI watcher removes it and stops watching; its widget may continue showing `installing` even after the installer exits. Check the adjacent `<worktree gitdir>/pi-deps/install.log` for installer command output and any `pi-deps:` failure message; the log remains available when the status file is removed. Reopening Pi does not restore a status already removed by the watcher.

The root lockfile selects the manager and command below. A matching `packageManager` declaration selects the same command regardless of its declared version; versions are not checked against the installed executable. Explicit `yarn@1.x` declarations fail fast because Yarn Classic is unsupported. With only `yarn.lock` and no `packageManager`, the hook assumes modern Yarn and runs `--immutable`; if the executable is Yarn Classic, installation fails in the background.

| Manager | Command | Lockfile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm | `npm ci` | `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json` |
| pnpm | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| Yarn | `yarn install --immutable` | `yarn.lock` (Yarn Classic 1.x is not supported) |
| Bun | `bun install --frozen-lockfile` | `bun.lock`, `bun.lockb` |
| uv | `uv sync --locked` | `uv.lock` |
