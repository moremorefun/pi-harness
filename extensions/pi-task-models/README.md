# `@henryqw/pi-task-models`

Choose shared model and thinking routes for extension tasks named `fast`, `balanced`, `frontier`, and `fav`. Users configure routes once while each extension keeps ownership of its task and default.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@henryqw/pi-task-models
```

Run `/task-models` after installation. Configure each profile that your installed consumers require.

## Works with

| Package | Relationship | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@henryqw/pi-auto-compact`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-auto-compact) | Consumer | Its local compaction task defaults to `fast`. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-herdr-btw`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-herdr-btw) | Consumer | Its local side-thread task defaults to `fast`. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-herdr-rename`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-herdr-rename) | Consumer | Its local rename task defaults to `fast`. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-memory`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-memory) | Consumer | Its local candidate-review task defaults to `balanced`. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-multi-codex`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-multi-codex) | Improves | Numbered Codex slots dedupe to one route. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-prompt-creator`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-prompt-creator) | Consumer | Its local prompt-drafting task defaults to `fast`. |
| [`@henryqw/pi-subagent`](https://pi.henry.wang/extensions/pi-subagent) | Consumer | Its local delegation task defaults to `fast`; callers can declare their own task. |

## Use

Run `/task-models` to complete the first setup:

1. Select `fast`.
2. Choose a primary model from Pi's effective registry, then choose its thinking level.
3. Choose a different fallback model and thinking level, or choose `None`.
4. Reopen `/task-models`. The `fast` row now shows the saved route instead of `not configured`.

| Surface | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/task-models` | command | For people: configure shared profile routes and assign profiles to active consumer tasks. |
| Session start | ui | For people: when the shared config is missing, show a warning that points to `/task-models`. |

Repeat these steps for `balanced`, `frontier`, or `fav` when a consumer needs them. The `fav` profile has no fallback.

Select an active task to override its declared profile. Choosing that task's declared default removes the override.

## Flow

Consumers register declarations at extension load. When `/task-models` opens, the shared control plane asks active extensions for declarations. Extension load order does not matter.

The control plane lists each active task's effective profile. Hidden explicit assignments stay stored when a consumer is disabled.

Menus and resolution use the current session's `ctx.scopedModels`, including pinned thinking. An empty scope uses available text models from Pi's registry. Numbered Codex account aliases are deduplicated.

Fallback choices exclude the selected primary. BTW selects the first authenticated viable route before pane launch.

## Config

The shared JSON file is at `~/.pi/agent/config/pi-task-models/config.json`. Only explicit `/task-models` actions save it.

The following JSON shows structure only. Every model ID is a placeholder and must not be copied.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "fast": {
      "primary": { "model": "<provider>/<fast-model-from-Pi>", "thinkingLevel": "low" },
      "fallback": { "model": "<provider>/<fallback-model-from-Pi>", "thinkingLevel": "low" }
    },
    "balanced": {
      "primary": { "model": "<provider>/<balanced-model-from-Pi>", "thinkingLevel": "high" }
    },
    "frontier": {
      "primary": { "model": "<provider>/<frontier-model-from-Pi>", "thinkingLevel": "max" }
    },
    "fav": {
      "primary": { "model": "<provider>/<favorite-model-from-Pi>", "thinkingLevel": "high" }
    }
  },
  "tasks": {
    "pi-herdr-btw/btw": "balanced"
  }
}
```

Use exact model IDs offered by `/task-models`. Pi's registry, not this example, defines available models.

| Name | Description | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `profiles` | Stores configured shared routes by profile name. | Object keyed by `fast`, `balanced`, `frontier`, or `fav`; unknown profile names are rejected. | `{}` (no profiles configured) |
| `profiles.<profile>.primary.model` | Selects the primary model. Required within a configured `primary` route. | Canonical `provider/model` reference without whitespace or NUL; available models come from Pi's model registry or session-scoped models. | — |
| `profiles.<profile>.primary.thinkingLevel` | Sets the primary model's thinking level. Required within a configured `primary` route. | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`; the model must support the level when the route resolves. | — |
| `profiles.<profile>.fallback` | Sets the route to try when the primary route is unavailable. | Object requiring `model` and `thinkingLevel` under the same rules as `primary`; not allowed for `fav`. | No fallback route. |
| `tasks` | Stores explicit profile overrides by task ID. | Object mapping task IDs (`<package>/<task>`) to profiles. | `{}` |
| `tasks.<taskId>` | Overrides that task's declared profile. | `fast`, `balanced`, `frontier`, or `fav`. | That task declaration's `defaultProfile` |

Pi's model registry, including session-scoped models, is the source of available models. This file does not contain a model catalog.

Task defaults live only in consumer declarations. Existing explicit assignments, including one equal to a declaration's default, remain valid.

Model references use canonical `provider/model`. Numbered Codex account aliases (`openai-codex-N`) resolve through Pi's registry and store canonically as `openai-codex/<model>`.

Consumers do not access the config file directly. `loadTaskModelsConfig()` returns `source` as `"file"` or `"missing"`, so consumers can warn when defaults are in use.

Profile thinking is authoritative. Resolution uses `config.tasks[task.id] ?? task.defaultProfile`.

Consumers never read or write the shared file directly.

## Limits and recovery

`loadTaskModelsConfig()` returns `{ source: "missing", value: { "profiles": {}, "tasks": {} } }` for a missing file. It does not create a file.

At session start, Task Models warns when the shared config is missing. Run `/task-models` to configure task routes.

Malformed JSON, unknown keys, invalid task IDs, unknown profiles, or invalid profile or route values cause config loading to fail; the file is preserved. Repair or restore the file before reopening `/task-models`, which cannot load or overwrite an invalid config.

Resolution errors are `TaskRouteError` values. Check `taskRouteCode`:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `config-missing` | The optional shared config file is absent. |
| `config-read` | A present shared config file cannot be read or validated; repair its contents or permissions before using `/task-models`. |
| `profile-missing` | The selected profile is not configured; set it in `/task-models`. |
| `no-route` | The selected profile has no available route; choose an available model and thinking level in `/task-models`. |

For `config-missing`, run `/task-models` to create the file. A consumer may silence only `config-missing` when it has a safe current-session fallback.

`executeTaskRoutes()` uses only caller-supplied resolved routes. It does not resolve routes, authenticate, inspect providers, log, wait, or retry a route.

It rejects empty route lists and checks its optional abort signal before every attempt. It stops on cancellation or when `shouldFallback(error)` returns false.

After allowed failures, it rethrows the final route error unchanged. Each attempt must be atomic and safe to repeat.
